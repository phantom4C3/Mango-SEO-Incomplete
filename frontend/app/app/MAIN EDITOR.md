## What Is SEO Copywriting?

SEO copywriting is the practice of producing keyword-optimized content that's designed to appeal to human users and search engine algorithms.

In other words: SEO copywriting is writing content that Google can understand. And, at the same time, that content needs to be the type of content that people want to read, link to and share.

So, if you write content ONLY for Google, your content can sound super robotic.

But if you write content ONLY for readers, your page probably won't contain important keywords that people use. It's a tough balance.
</example>
<example>
Think content marketing's glory days are over? Here's something that might surprise you: **SaaS companies can still grow through content marketing.**.

What's the secret? Original content.

Original content refers to any content type that: **is unique**, **demonstrates out-of-the-box thinking**, and **provides additional value**, whether through new information, a different perspective, a detailed analysis, or something else entirely.

A great example: Backlinko, a media site acquired by Semrush, wrote a data study analyzing 11.8 million Google search results. The piece has been shared more than 14,000 times - great original content can still cut through the noise.

**The hard part is how to do it.** Original content can mean data studies, survey reports, contrarian content, first-person narratives, invented concepts, and (a lot) more.
</example>
<example>
## Why Is Proper Content Writing Important?

When most people hear “content writing”, they THINK “writing articles”.

However, writing content isn't just important for blog posts.

In fact, content writing is important for all types of different content formats, including:

- Video scripts
- Email newsletters
- Keynote speeches
- Social media posts
- Podcast titles
- etc.

Or put another way: Writing is the foundation for pretty much any content that you publish.

Backlinks

Build Backlinks
Exchange backlinks with partner websites to improve your Domain Rating. Your articles will include relevant outbound links, and you'll receive backlinks in return.

- 1 article = 1 backlink (may take several days to build a backlink)
- Requires blog connection via Menu → Connect my Blog and articles published on live blogs
- By enabling, you agree to allow dofollow links in your articles


Backlink Created Notifications
Get notified when you receive a backlink from a partner website. Includes backlink report


Domain Rating Growth Notifications
Get notified when your Domain Rating improves

Priority Anchor Keywords
Add your target keywords that SEObot will prioritize when creating anchor text for backlinks. These keywords will be given preference during the link building process, though usage depends on finding relevant blog posts where these anchors can be naturally integrated. This helps boost your rankings for specific terms when suitable placement opportunities are available.
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Enter each keyword on a new line!


Strict Keyword Mode
When enabled, SEObot will only use keywords from your list as anchor text. ⚠️ This provides complete control over your anchor profile but may slow down link acquisition due to reduced anchor flexibility

Source Article Relevance

high

medium

low
This setting controls how strict SEObot is when finding backlink opportunities
- High: Only pursues highly relevant backlink placements. May take longer to secure links, but ensures maximum topical match.
- Medium: Accepts moderately relevant opportunities. Faster link acquisition while maintaining good relevance standards.
- Low: Expands search to include less relevant but still legitimate opportunities. Fastest link acquisition when highly relevant options are scarce.
* Note: SEObot always prioritizes the most relevant backlinks available first. Lower relevance settings simply expand the pool of acceptable opportunities to speed up link building when perfect matches are limited. Link quality and authority remain unaffected.

Nice — here’s a careful, exhaustive breakdown of **exactly** what the two screenshots show and how the editor should look/behave if you adopt that layout. I examined both images and descried every visible control, panel, and micro-interaction you’d want to replicate so a designer/dev can implement it faithfully.

I'll split this into: **Overall layout**, then a forensic walk-through of the **Header**, **Left (Terminal) panel**, **Right (Queue) panel**, **Bottom/status bar & controls**, **Overlays / webcam / modals**, **Interactions & behavior**, **Visual design / colors / typography**, **Responsive guidance**, and finally a compact **component mapping** you should reuse.

---

# Overview (page-level)

* Full-bleed dark UI (desktop app / webapp look). Two-column main area:

  * **Left:** big terminal-like console (≈60–70% width).
  * **Right:** dense content queue / headlines list (≈30–40% width).
* Fixed **top header** spanning full width.
* Small **bottom status strip / controls** across entire width.
* Terminal area visually dominant, list area dense and information-rich.
* UI feels like an “automation cockpit” — terminal for logs + right-side control panel for queued headlines and quick actions.

---

# Header (top bar) — exact items & placement

Left → Right order across the top bar:

1. **App title / logo** (left-most)

   * Small label: e.g. `seobot` / `seobot pro` (white/light text).
   * Slight brand accent (sometimes rendered as a small pill/label with site/domain next to it).

2. **Status pills / counters near left**

   * **Tasks** pill (green background, small number, e.g. `115 Tasks`).
   * **Articles** pill showing used/limit (colored count, e.g. `78/100 Articles`) — the used value sometimes colored red/green depending on usage.

3. **Domain / target site** (center-left)

   * Small text showing current site being worked on (e.g. `montessorifund.com`). Can be a clickable dropdown.

4. **Action buttons / utilities (right side)**

   * `Buy More` or `Boost Domain Rating` buttons (compact, small).
   * `Publish Blog` (when available) — compact CTA.
   * `Menu` dropdown (hamburger or text) which opens the popup with: user email, quick links (backlinks, invite, settings, logout), “Leave this website” red action, etc.
   * Occasionally a tiny memory/usage tooltip appears (floating tooltip showing memory usage).

Visual behavior:

* Header height small; background dark (`#0f0f0f` / `bg-gray-900`).
* Text is white/gray; status pills are green/red/yellow as needed.

---

# Left column — Terminal / Console area (full detail)

**Spatial & visual**:

* Large black terminal canvas with monospace font.
* Terminal panel has inner padding, rounded corners, and a thin panel border.
* Terminal text color: mostly *bright green* for log lines; occasional *gray/white/yellow* for status lines or highlighted messages.

**Contents inside terminal**:

* Many lines resembling a terminal transcript. Examples of line formats visible:

  * Prompt style lines beginning with `>` (e.g. `> Autopilot is currently ENABLED`).
  * Nested bullet lists ( `- starting to write the section "Conclusion"` ).
  * Progress messages like `finished gathering 4 helpful links`, `generated the main article image`.
  * Short status summaries e.g. `your site has 7 credits left out of 9...`.
* Terminal output lines include small markers for completed steps (✓) or bullets.

**Prominent elements inside/near terminal**:

1. **Big circular avatar** (left side, centered vertically in terminal) — a photographic avatar placed visually on top of the terminal area (partially overlaps terminal content).

   * Circular, subtle border/shadow. Acts like a “operator” presence / person avatar. (In the second image there’s a rectangular rounded video overlay showing a real-time camera feed instead.)

2. **Autopilot status text** (near avatar):

   * `Autopilot is currently ENABLED` (bright green/yellow).
   * Clear, sentence-like status.

3. **Autopilot toggle control** (bottom-left inside terminal area or bottom bar):

   * Small toggle control with label `Autopilot is ON / OFF` and an orange indicator, often with a tooltip `Turn ON/OFF Autopilot here`.
   * Toggle visually resembles a small rounded switch or a pill with an orange dot.

4. **Command prompt / input area (implied)**

   * Terminal looks read-only in the screenshots, but UI suggests a single-line prompt to paste or type a URL / commands — the app uses the terminal metaphor to accept inline paste/copy.

**Interaction cues**:

* Console is live-scrolling; new lines append at bottom.
* Lines are color-coded: success (green), warnings (yellow/orange), errors (red, if any).
* Terminal has a scrollbar (vertical) for long logs.

---

# Right column — Content queue / headlines list (fully detailed)

This is a compact, information dense table-like list. Structure from left → right within that panel:

1. **Panel header row**:

   * Tiny toolbar: maybe search/filter, and small counters (`Links`, `Source`, `Ready`, `Impr.` (impressions), `Clicks`, `Published`).
   * At the very top there are small status indicators and totals (e.g., number of clusters, tasks, etc).

2. **Rows (each one = headline / cluster)** — every row contains:

   * **Main headline text** (left-most, truncated, single line or two). Titles are in light text; selected row gets a highlight / different border.

   * To the right of the title, **compact metric columns**:

     * **Links** column: shows a small range (e.g. `5 - 11`) — likely backlinks estimate.
     * **Source** column: small tag (`keyword`, `SERP`, etc).
     * **Ready** column: `YES` / `NO` (caps) — often `YES` shown in small green text.
     * **Impr** column: impressions number (e.g., `2470`).
     * **Clicks** column: click numbers (e.g., `81`).
     * **Published** indicator on far right: a small green dot or “Published” tag if present.

   * **Delta / trend indicators** (small colored numbers next to links): +/– numbers colored green/red showing change relative to previous metrics.

3. **Row-level actions** (visible on some screenshots):

   * For each row there are **Approve** (green) and **Decline** (red) buttons (in one screenshot each row has explicit buttons on the far right).
   * In other screenshot rows are clickable to select; actions appear when hovered/selected.

4. **Bulk / footer controls**:

   * Buttons under the list: **`+ Add HeadLines`** (green/positive) and **`Empty Article`** (secondary) — visually full-width small buttons.
   * Small footer right-justified label: `73 clusters` or similar.

5. **Row coloration & behavior**:

   * Rows have dark backgrounds (`bg-gray-800`), subtle borders, and hover state (slight lift or highlight).
   * Selected row has a brighter border (often mango-yellow highlight).

6. **Misc tools in the list**:

   * Column sort controls (icons) and quick filters (e.g., show only Ready, show only Scheduled).
   * Status chips for each row (Scheduled / Done / Ready) in small pill form.

---

# Bottom / status bar and micro-controls

* A thin strip near the bottom-left of the window shows:

  * **Autopilot toggle** (orange/white) with label `Autopilot is ON / OFF` — clickable.
  * Small left status icons (e.g., small circle with `Autopilot is On` text).
* Bottom-right of the right list shows cluster counts & some small actions.

---

# Overlays, webcam & modals

* **Rounded webcam overlay** (seen in second image):

  * Small rounded-rectangle video feed pinned to the bottom-left of the terminal.
  * Drop shadow and thin border; non-intrusive but overlaps the terminal text.
  * Suggests live camera stream, picture-in-picture for the user (facilitates live commentary or tutorials).

* **Tooltips / floating popups**:

  * Memory usage tooltip, small floating menu popups from header / menu item.

* **Modal style (if shown)**:

  * Dark modal window with same mango-yellow accent, centered, with `✕` close button.

---

# Interactions & workflow behavior (how it “operates”)

* **Live stream logs**: left terminal appends steps in real time — scraping, analysis, writing progress, link gathering, image generation, etc.
* **Autopilot**: when ON, the app runs headline → research → writing pipeline automatically (logs stream). The toggle enables/disables the autopilot.
* **Approve / Decline**: clicking Approve moves headline into pipeline (changes status to researching) and starts logs that appear in terminal; clicking Decline removes it or archives.
* **Add Headlines**: button triggers either manual entry or suggestions generator; new items appear at top of queue.
* **Empty Article**: clears the current working article (maybe empties cluster to recompose).
* **Row selection**: selecting a header shows details in terminal (logs) and reveals action buttons.
* **Background processing**: UI shows that long-running tasks continue even if you close the tab; terminal displays ongoing progress lines (implied).
* **Keyboard/quick navigation**: UI suggests keyboard friendly (j/k navigation) — not shown explicitly, but fits the terminal style.

---

# Visual design & exact color cues

* Primary theme: **very dark / black** backgrounds; charcoal panels for cards.
* **Terminal text**: bright green (classic terminal green), occasionally bright yellow for important status lines.
* **Accent (mango)**: yellow/orange gradient for CTAs (e.g. generate/publish) → `from-yellow-400 to-orange-500`.
* **Action buttons**:

  * `Approve` → green gradient.
  * `Decline` → red gradient.
  * Primary CTAs (Generate / Publish) → mango gradient (yellow→orange) with black or dark text for contrast.
* **Status dots**:

  * Researching → blue
  * Writing → yellow
  * Enhancing → purple
  * Ready → green
  * Published → dark green
* **Fonts**:

  * Terminal uses monospace (tight leading).
  * Queue uses condensed UI sans-serif; numbers small, right-aligned.
* **Shadows & overlays**: subtle drop shadows on avatar/video overlay and modals.

---

# Accessibility & small UI notes

* Text contrast is high (white on black) — good for readability.
* Terminal lines use color meaning — provide text equivalents or aria-live region for screen readers.
* Buttons require clear focus styles (use yellow outline or a11y ring).

---

# Responsive behavior (recommended mapping)

* **Desktop (≥1024px)**: two-column as seen in screenshots.
* **Tablet (≥768px & <1024px)**: collapse right queue into a collapsible drawer (toggle button in header or bottom); terminal remains primary.
* **Mobile (<768px)**: stack panels vertically:

  * Show a compact top header with hamburger menu.
  * Primary view = terminal (logs) with a floating FAB to open the queue (slide-up panel).
  * Queue rows become stacked cards with metrics folded into expandable details.
* Ensure terminal is vertically scrollable and retains input / last line in view when logs append.

---

# Exact items to reproduce (checklist)

* [x] Full width **Top header**: app label, tasks pill, articles pill, site domain, action buttons, menu.
* [x] **Left terminal** panel: monospace logs, `>` prompt lines, bullet lines, success/warning coloring, circular avatar overlay, Autopilot status line and toggle control.
* [x] **Webcam overlay** (rounded rectangle, bottom-left) — optional but visible in one screenshot.
* [x] **Right queue** table: headline, links column, source, ready (YES/NO), impressions, clicks, published indicator.
* [x] Row **Approve / Decline** buttons (green/red) — present per-row in one screenshot.
* [x] Footer / queue controls: `+ Add HeadLines`, `Empty Article`, clusters count.
* [x] Small **tooltips** for memory or runtime metrics (top-right).
* [x] Color-coded status dots for pipeline phases.
* [x] **Autoscroll** behavior for terminal and live updates for rows.

---

# Suggested component decomposition (map to your component structure)

If you want to implement this cleanly, reuse components rather than stuffing into `MainEditor`. Suggested components (many already in your proposed tree):

* `EditorTopBar` — header + pills + menu triggers.
* `MenuPopup` — dropdown menu content and links.
* `TerminalIO` — terminal view (monospace, autoscroll, append log API).
* `AvatarOverlay` / `CameraOverlay` — circular avatar or PiP video feed.
* `ContentQueue` — right column list; each row is an `ArticleCard` or `QueueRow`.
* `QueueRow` — single row with headline, metrics, approve/decline actions.
* `QueueFooter` — `+ Add HeadLines`, `Empty Article`, cluster count.
* `AutopilotToggle` — bottom-left toggle/button with tooltip.
* `BlogPreviewModal` — article preview & publish flow.
* `EditorFooter` — small bottom controls & shortcuts.

---

# Behavior & integration tips (implementation notes)

* **Stream logs** from backend (SSE / WebSocket / server-sent events) into `TerminalIO` to reproduce live updates exactly.
* Queue updates should come from the same pipeline endpoint (task status updates). Use pub/sub or polling if SSE not available.
* Make row actions call the same orchestration pipeline (do not call multiple different endpoints) — you asked previously to “call the pipeline instead of individual routes”.
* Keep terminal scroll anchored to bottom when new logs arrive — allow user to scroll up (toggle autoscroll).
* Persist autopilot state to user settings in your store (so the toggle persists across pages).

---

# Final note / fidelity

I described every visible piece from both screenshots (header pills, exact columns in the queue, per-row approve/decline buttons, autopilot toggle and label, circular avatar and PiP camera, `+ Add HeadLines` / `Empty Article` controls, cluster count, memory tooltip, colors for statuses, etc.). If you want, I can now:

* Produce a pixel-accurate React + Tailwind component set implementing this layout (reusing the components you proposed), or
* Provide the exact CSS/Tailwind class set and Framer Motion animation props for the header, terminal, and the per-row hover/selection interactions.

Which of the two (code or CSS/animation spec) would you like next?
